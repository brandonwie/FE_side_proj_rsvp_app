# RSVP Application
> Additional project with TeamTreehouse

## Things need to be improved
1. validation
    - reject empty strings from being added
    - append a message to the DOM when you pass empty strings
2. checkbox
    - confirm -> confirmed when the box is checked (text nodes)
    - create addition text area for a note function or checkboxes using select element instead of checkbox
    - to improve a user experience, make the hide button to remove invitees who already confirmed
3. local storage
    - save the state of the application
